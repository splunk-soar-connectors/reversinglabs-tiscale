### RL TitaniumScale Enterprise File Visibility

Publisher: ReversingLabs

Product Vendor: ReversingLabs

This app integrates with ReversingLabs TiScale Enterprise Scale File Visibility platform to automate analysis and investigative actions for file samples.

This app supports using ReversingLabs Advanced File Analysis to 'detonate file' on the TitaniumScale Advanced Malware Analysis Appliance. 

The ReversingLabs TitaniumScale Appliance is powered by TitaniumCore, the malware analysis engine that performs automated static analysis using the Active File Decomposition technology. 

TitaniumCore unpacks and recursively analyzes files without executing them, and extracts internal threat indicators to classify files and determine their threat level. TitaniumCore is capable of identifying thousands of file format families. It recursively unpacks hundreds of file format families, and fully repairs extracted files to enable further analysis.
